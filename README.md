# checkm8-webusb

i mean, in theory this should work on any device (sans ChromeOS because it suxx) that can run google chrome. don't know though. drivers are funky.

The end goal for this project is to be able to run checkm8 in a web browser over WebUSB.
Maybe checkra1n as well, although that'd take a lot of porting and source code that isnt out yet.
WebUSB absolutely SUCKS.
Mostly JavaScript though. I hate JavaScript. Like really badly.
